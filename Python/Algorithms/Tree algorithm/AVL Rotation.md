If you need a "bubble up" a given node without destroying the Binary Search Tree properties, you can make an AVL Rotation.

AVL Rotation can be done in two directions: right or left.
***Left Rotation***:

When a node is added into the right subtree of the right subtree, if the tree gets out of balance, we do a single left rotation.

***Right Rotation***:

If a node is added to the left subtree of the left subtree, the AVL tree may get out of balance, we do a single right rotation.
