Dynamically-allocated data structures which represents a set of linked objects - nodes

Each node has a pointer pointing to the node directly after it (for internal nodes) or a null pointer (for tail nodes). We can traverse Linked List in only one direction?

Finding an element: O(N) - the worst case
Insertion an element: O(N) - the worst case, O(1) - the best case
Remove an element: O(N) - the worst case, O(1) - the best case
