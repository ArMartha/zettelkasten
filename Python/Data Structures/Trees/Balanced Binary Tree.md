Balanced binary tree is one where most leaves are equidistant from the root and most internal nodes have two children. A *perfectly balanced*  tree is one where *all* leaves are equidistant from the root, and *all* internal nodes have two children The term "balanced" can be generalized to any *k*-ary tree: a balanced *k*-ary tree is one where many (or most) internal nodes have exactly *k* children and all leaves are roughly equidistant from the root.


Perfectly balanced binary tree with *n* elements has a height of **log2(n+1)-1**
