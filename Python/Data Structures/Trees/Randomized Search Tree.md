Special type of [[Treap]], instead of us supplying both a _key_ and a _priority_ for insertion, we only supply a _key_, and the _priority_ for the new (_key_, _priority_) pair is randomly generated for us.
**Randomized Search Tree** is able to exploit the functionality of a [[Treap]] with random number generation in order to achieve the theoretical 
**O(log _n_) average-case time complexity** _in practice_ for the **Binary Search Tree** ([[Algorithms/Binary Search Tree]]]) operations.
