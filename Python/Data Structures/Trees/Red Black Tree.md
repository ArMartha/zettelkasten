[[Binary Search Tree]] in which following four properties must hold:
1. All must be colored either red or black
2. The root of the tree must be black
3. If node is red,, all of its children must be black
4. For any given node u, every possible path from u to a "null reference" must contain the same number of black nodes
"Null references" are colored black

 **Red-Black Trees** do indeed also have a **O(log _n_) worst-case** time complexity.
