Unbalanced binary tree is one where many internal nodes have exactly one child and/or leaves are not equidistant from the root. A *perfectly unbalanced* binary tree is one where *all* internal nodes have exactly one child. The term "unbalanced" can be generalized to any *k*-ary tree: an unbalanced *k*-ary tree is one where many internal nodes have less than *k* children (the more extreme deviation from *k* children, the more unbalanced the tree)

For perfectly unbalanced tree height would be **n-1**
